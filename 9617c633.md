A **Zettelkasten** is a method of note-taking pioneered by [Conrad Gessner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Gessner) and famously used by [Niklas Luhmann]. The concept revolves around gathering [[0cf5ce5a]] in a slip box (or digital equivalent thereof), each uniquely described by an ID[^id]. These IDs can then be used as referrals or [[2d7f3d20]] between notes. In its simplest form, a Zettelkasten is a graph where the nodes are notes and the connections are links. The appeal of this process is that connections between knowledge - often never found elsewhere - appears dynamically, allowing for a deeper connection with the topic at hand.

[^id]: This ID can be whatever you prefer, as long as it is unique. The preffered method for physical Zettelkasten is to use numbers based on the date and time (e.g. 202003202350). For software-based Zettelkasten, however, one could just use the title of the note or a generated ID of sorts (like the one in the URL of this page).
