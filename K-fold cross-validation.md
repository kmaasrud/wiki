**$K$-fold [[Cross-validation]]** involves splitting our dataset into $K$ different "folds". Say, in our example, that we use $K=6$ and divide our dataset into six different folds. First, we use the first fold as our [[Testing set|testing set]], train on the other five and compute the prediction error of the fitted model. Then, we use the second fold as our [[Testing set|testing set]] and train on the remaining sets, this time also computing the prediction error. Doing this cycle through all $K=6$ folds and averaging the prediction errors gives us our [[Cross-validation]] estimate of the prediction error. 

An illustration of this from [Qinkai's blog](http://qingkaikong.blogspot.com/2017/02/machine-learning-9-more-on-artificial.html):

Denoting the fitted function that excludes the $k$th fold as $\hat f^{-k}(X)$, and defining a function $\kappa:\{1,\dots,N\}\rightarrow\{1,\dots,K\}$ that takes in an index of the total dataset and returns the index of the fold containing that datapoint, we can write the [[Cross-validation]] estimate of the prediction error as

$$ \text{CV}(\hat f) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NL\left(y_i, \hat f^{-\kappa(i)}(x_i)\right) .$$

With a set of models indexed by the tuning parameter $\alpha$, we see that

$$ \text{CV}(\hat f,\alpha) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NL\left(y_i, \hat f^{-\kappa(i)}(x_i, \alpha)\right) $$

is the curve we need to find the minimum of. The value of $\alpha$ minimizing this curve is often denoted $\hat \alpha$, and we now choose our final model to be $f(x,\hat \alpha)$.
