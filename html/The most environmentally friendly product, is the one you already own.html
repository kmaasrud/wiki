<h1>The most environmentally friendly product, is the one you already own</h1>

<article>
<p>This saying might sound obvious, but as a rule of thought it can be very powerful. Many products will market themselves as green - and that may be entirely true<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> - but there will always be some waste associated with the production of a product. Forcing yourself to reevaluate the need to replace something you already own even if the replacement is “green”, will lead to lesser resource waste.</p>
<p>That said, a counter-argument can be made: Supporting companies that try to change the market, will aid in making that happen. <a href="Vote%20with%20your%20money.html">Vote with your money</a>, as they say. <a href="Fairphone.html">Fairphone</a> is a great example of a company worth supporting, though they actually implore their customers to <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2019/05/20/the-most-sustainable-phone-is-the-one-you-already-own/">do just what this note is about</a>.</p>
