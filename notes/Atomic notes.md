**Atomic notes** are notes that are as focused to *one* concept, subject or idea as possible. The purpose of this is to allow for reusability of your notes. If your notes are properly atomic, they can be relevantly linked to, almost regardless of context. This accrues connections between subjects and subsequently deep knowledge.
