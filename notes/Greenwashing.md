**Greenwashing** is a term used to describe the act of marketing based on false or disinformative claims of the product or service being sustainable and environmentally friendly.

An example of greenwashing is the well-known scandal of [[Volkswagen]], who cheated on emission tests by fitting an intentionally defect measuring device to their vehicles. Additionally, they touted their low-emission features from the same vehicles[^1].
