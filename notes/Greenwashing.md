**Greenwashing** is a term used to describe the act of marketing based on false or disinformative claims of the product or service being sustainable and environmentally friendly.

A bad example of greenwashing is the well-known scandal of [[Volkswagen]], who cheated on emission tests by fitting an intentionally defect measuring device to their vehicles. Additionally, they touted their low-emission features from the same vehicles[^1].
