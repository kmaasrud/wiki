The **ideal gas law** is the equation of state followed by [[Ideal gas|ideal gases]]. The general case equation is[^malthe-sørensen]:

$$ pV = Nk_\text{B}T .$$

Here $p$ is the pressure of the gas, $V$ is the volume it consumes, $N$ is the amount of particles it consists of, $k_\text{B}$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and $T$ is the temperature.
