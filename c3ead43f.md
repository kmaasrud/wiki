The **ideal gas law** is the equation of state followed by #[[54cb95a5]]es. The general case equation is

$$ pV = Nk_\text{B}T .$$

Here $p$ is the pressure of the gas, $V$ is the volume it consumes, $N$ is the amount of particles it consists of, $k_\text{B}$ is the [[05422b35]] and $T$ is the temperature.
