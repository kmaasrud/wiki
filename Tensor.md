A tensor is (put non-rigorously) a generalization of numbers, represented by a multidimensional array with respect to a given basis[^wiki].

A tensor is described by its *order*. An order 0 tensor is a scalar, an order 1 is a vector, an order 2 is a matrix and so on. Tensors are usually denoted using [[Index notation|index notation]].
