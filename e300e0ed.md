Many will recognize the concept of *evergreen notes*[^1] (the most common among many coined terms for the concept). These are living notes, often referenced and tended to like trees in a garden of knowledge. This concept resonates with me, but lets propose a simplification...

In essence, there are two types of notes:

- **Static** notes: These are (generally speaking) *fleeting notes*. Often used as a scratchpad or e.g. during lectures, these are useful for supporting working memory, but are most likely forgotten or quickly discarded. They serve no lasting purpose.
- **Dynamic** notes: These are similar to the abovementioned *evergreen notes*. Often based on knowledge or ideas aquired from static notes, they are generalized, atomic[^atomic] and constantly evolving. They should ideally represent the current knowledge of the writer, and aid their memory.

Static and dynamic notes represent two equally important aspects of note-taking that should complement eachother in a *dance* of knowledge aquirement.
