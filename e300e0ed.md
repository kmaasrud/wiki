Many will recognize the concept of *evergreen notes*[^evergreen] (the most common among many coined terms). Evergreen notes are "living" notes, which are densely interlinked and tended to like trees in a garden of knowledge. This concept resonates with me, but lets propose a simplification...

In essence, there are two types of notes:

- **Static** notes: These are (generally speaking) *fleeting notes*, *project notes* or literature notes [(Liu, 2021)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017#Four_kinds_of_notes). For me, these are often used during lectures or as a scratchpad, and are useful for supporting working memory. However, they are commonly forgotten or quickly discarded and serve no actual lasting purpose.
- **Dynamic** notes: These notes are similar to the abovementioned concept of *evergreen notes*. Based on knowledge or ideas aquired from static notes, they are generalized, atomic[^atomic] and constantly evolving. They should ideally represent the current knowledge of the writer, and aid their memory.

Static and dynamic notes represent two equally important aspects of note-taking that should complement eachother.
