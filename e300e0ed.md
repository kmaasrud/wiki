There's a commonly used concept of *evergreen notes* (I recommend you to explore [Maggie Appleton's incredible visualisation](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens) if you are unfamiliar with this term.) Evergreen notes are "living" notes, which are densely interlinked and tended to like trees in a garden.[^matuschak] This concept resonates with me, but lets propose a simplification...

In essence, there are two types of notes:

- **Static** notes: These are (generally speaking) *fleeting notes*, *project notes* or *literature notes*[^liu]. For me, these are often used during lectures or as a scratchpad, and are useful for supporting working memory. However, they are normally forgotten or quickly discarded and thus serve no actual lasting purpose.
- **Dynamic** notes: These notes are similar to the abovementioned concept of *evergreen notes*. Based on knowledge or ideas aquired from static notes, they are generalized, [[0cf5ce5a|atomic]] and constantly evolving. They should ideally represent the current knowledge of the writer, and aid their memory.

Static and dynamic notes represent two equally important aspects of note-taking that should complement eachother.
