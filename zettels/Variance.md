The **variance** of a variable $X$ refers to the [[Expected value]] of the squared difference between $X$ and its [[Mean]].[^wiki] In other words, it is a measure of how much a set of data is spread around its average.

In the *discrete case*, a variable $X$ with [[Probability mass function]] $p$ has the variance:

$$ \text{Var}(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^N p_i\cdot(x_i - \mu)^2 ,$$

where $\mu$ is the [[Mean]].
