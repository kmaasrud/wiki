The *expected value* of a variable $X$ is a generalization of the [[Mean|mean]] of said value.[^wiki] In other words, it is the *weighted* [[Mean|mean]].

In the *discrete case*, consider a set of data $X = {x_1, ..., x_N}$ where $p_i$ represents the probability of $x_i$ occuring. Here the expected value is:

$$ \mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i = 1}^N p_i x_i $$
