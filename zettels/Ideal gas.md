An **ideal gas** is a gas consisting of particles that do not interact with eachother (particles can interact with elastic or point-like collisions while still following the ideal gas model.)[^wiki] The model is purely theoretical, but a useful approximation in many cases. All ideal gases follow the [[Ideal gas law|ideal gas law]].
