The **residual sum of squares function** is the following:

$$ \text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(y_i - \hat y_i\right)^2 ,$$

where $y_i$ is the $i$th variable to be predicted and $\hat y_i$ is the predicted value of $y_i$. It is often used as a #[[Cost function|cost function]] in the training of a linear regression model.
