title: Welcome to my brain!

This is my personal [[9617c633]], which means it serves as my knowledge management system. I try too keep these notes as [[e300e0ed|dynamic]] as possible, but there may crop up some book or lecture notes here and there. Please beware that these notes are for personal use and are probably utterly useless to you. If you do get some use of them, that would make me very happy!

Go ahead and follow any link you want, that should probably lead you down a rabbit-hole into my mind. As a starting point, there's also an index of all the notes contained here, which you can explore by clicking [this button](https://www.kmaasrud.com/brain/impulse). Enjoy!

## Link types

All links colored like <span class="zettel-link-container"><span class="zettel-link"><a style="text-decoration: none;">this</a></span></span> are zettel links, while links colored like <a style="text-decoration: none;">this</a> are normal hyperlinks.
