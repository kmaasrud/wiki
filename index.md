title: Welcome to my brain!
---

This is my personal [[9617c633]], which means it serves as knowledge management system. I try too keep these notes as dynamic as possible[^dynamic]. Please beware that this slip box of notes is for personal use and might be (probably is) utterly useless to you. If you actually do get some use of the content here, that would make me very happy! Be sure to say hello in that case: <km@aasrud.com>.

Go ahead and follow any link you want, that should probably lead you down a rabbit-hole into my mind. As a starting point, there's also an index of all the notes contained here, which you can explore by clicking [this button](https://www.kmaasrud.com/brain/impulse). Enjoy!

## Link types

All links colored like <span class="zettel-link-container"><span class="zettel-link"><a style="text-decoration: none;">this</a></span></span> are internal, while links colored like <a style="text-decoration: none;">this</a> are normal hyperlinks.
