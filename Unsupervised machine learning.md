Unsupervised machine learning is a subcategory of [[Machine learning]] that
considers a set of unlabelled data and finds common patterns between the
datapoints to extract knowledge based on how the data clusters. This is in
contrast to [[Supervised machine learning]], which has labelled examples to
learn from.
