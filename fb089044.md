As in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], where every generalized coordinate has a corresponding generalized momentum, the field $\phi(x,t)$ has a **conjugate momentum field**, defined as the partial derivative of the [[Lagrangian density]] with respect to the time derivative of the field:

$$\pi(x^\mu)\equiv \frac{\partial \mathcal L}{\partial \dot \phi}, \qquad \dot \phi \equiv \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$$
