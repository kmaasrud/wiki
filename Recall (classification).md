In statistical classification, the *recall* of a classifier over a class is the
ratio between the number of times a class got predicted correctly and the number
of times that class actually appears in the corresponding dataset.

$$ \text{recall}(x) = \frac{N_{\text{correctly predicted}}(x)}{N(x)}, $$

where $x$ is the class being classified.

Typically, this appears in binary classification, where we want to compare the
number of true positives against the number of positives.

[[F-score]].
