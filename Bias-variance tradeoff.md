The **bias-variance tradeoff** is the property where a predictive model with a *low #[[Bias]]* has a *higher #[[Variance]]* and vice versa. 

- High #[[Bias]] can cause a model to miss important relations between features and target outputs.
- High #[[Variance]] can lead to the random noise of the [[Training set]] to be modeled, namely [[Overfitting]]. This, in turn, will likely lead to greater errors when introduced to the [[Testing set]].
