The **bias-variance tradeoff** is the property where a predictive model with a *low #[[e60ae578]]* has a *higher #[[839a2287]]* and vice versa. 

- High #[[e60ae578]] can cause a model to miss important relations between features and target outputs.
- High #[[839a2287]] can lead to the random noise of the [[656f4d24]] to be modeled, namely [[ee0e86b6]]. This, in turn, will likely lead to greater errors when introduced to the [[08f9b9c9]].

An often used simplification of this tradeoff reads[^1]:

> Bias is related with a model failing to fit the training set and variance is related with a model failing to fit the testing set.
