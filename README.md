This is my personal [[Zettelkasten|collection of connected notes]], made with [mdzk](https://mdzk.app). I try too keep these notes as [[Dynamic vs static notes|dynamic]] and [[Atomic notes|atomic]] as possible, but there may crop up some book or lecture notes here and there. Please beware that these notes are for personal use and are probably utterly useless to you. If you do get some use of them, that would make me very happy!
